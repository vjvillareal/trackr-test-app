# Trackr (Test App)

## Description

Welcome! This is a free time-tracking app made solely with Angular framework.

There is a quote that says: “Time is non-refundable, use it with intention.” Whether you are a freelancer or a business owner, a time tracking app is an essential tool to help you and your team: from simply getting more things done to recording billable hours, it can assist you to become more efficient at doing your job.

This is a simple and easy-to-use time tracking app suited to people who are not looking for advanced features. It lets you track in real time when starting various tasks and projects. You can also add time manually, in case you forget to launch the timer. For a more detailed record or invoicing-related matters, you can manage your tasks by separating them into different projects – giving you a complete overview of your work.
